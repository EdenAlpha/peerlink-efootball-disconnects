/**
 * F32 eFootball match automation — capture-trigger state machine.
 *
 * Two validated full-time signatures (both from real FT-tapped captures):
 *
 *  PATH A — 54B tail. The game's dying tick stream shrinks its payload to a
 *  uniform ~54 bytes (never seen anywhere else across whole captures: goals,
 *  half-time, replays and transient dips — lowest observed dip 17pps — all
 *  ride 89-243B payloads) roughly 1s before the PPS cliff. The goodbye is a
 *  burst, not a stray: field traces show 45 len-54 packets exchanged in
 *  ~1.1s (20+ per direction), while mid-game strays are 1-2 packets. Only a
 *  burst (>= PATH_A_MIN_BURST in one 1Hz poll) opens the 4fps capture; lone
 *  54Bs are logged and ignored, and they no longer disarm Path B. We then
 *  expect the game feed to reach ~0pps within 3s (the cliff is 27->0 in
 *  ~2-3s, never a gradual slope). Confirmed cliff -> keep capturing at most
 *  20 more seconds while score reading runs (the stats board appears only
 *  after the result menu, so the tail must outlive it); a verified score
 *  stops capture early. No cliff within 3s -> pause capture for up to 1.5s; if the feed
 *  reaches ~0pps inside that window (delayed cliff), capture resumes and all
 *  frames feed the reader; otherwise the 54B was noise and the burst ends.
 *
 *  PATH B — deep PPS drop without any 54B. A game feed under 9pps sustained
 *  (real gameplay never came close: floor was 17pps for 1-2.5s blips) is a
 *  strong end signal on its own. Capture immediately for at most 10s. Any
 *  54B packets that appear during a Path-B burst are ignored: the burst is
 *  already running on stronger evidence and mixing trigger semantics only
 *  invites state-machine confusion.
 *
 * Both paths share: the 5-minute gate after T0 (a real match is at least
 * that long), mandatory locked H/A roles, the 4fps producer / single-OCR
 * consumer pipeline with capacity-1 frame dropping, two agreeing frames
 * before a candidate is real, eFootball-foreground checks, and full-time
 * screen text ("full time" / "match ended" / "final result") for auto
 * commits. The manual FT tap remains the human override with the fake-FT
 * forfeit; every tap is now logged.
 *
 * Hot-path work is intentionally tiny: one delta calculation per native
 * stats poll plus two integer compares; screen capture/OCR exists only in
 * the short post-whistle bursts.
