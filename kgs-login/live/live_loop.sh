# Live control loop: lets a human drive the phone in near-real-time.
#
# Why this exists instead of a tunnel: GitHub runners accept no inbound
# connections, so adb cannot be reached from outside. Instead the two sides
# rendezvous through two branches that never conflict, because each side only
# ever WRITES one of them:
#
#   live-cmd  operator -> runner   (a single file, cmd.txt, one command)
#   live-res  runner   -> operator (screenshots, dumps, logs)
#
# A round trip takes 30-60 seconds: slow enough to feel deliberate, fast
# enough to tap through a setup screen in minutes instead of blind runs.
#
# Commands (one per line in live-cmd/cmd.txt, first line wins):
#   tap X Y            touch the screen there, then screenshot
#   taps X1 Y1 X2 Y2.. several touches in one round trip, then screenshot
#   wait N             sleep N seconds, then screenshot (downloads, long screens)
#   shot [name]        screenshot only
#   uidump             full clickable-node dump (geometry for aiming)
#   uitap REGEX        tap by node text (native UI; Compose hides text)
#   amstart COMP       am start -W -n COMP (launch an activity)
#   intent URI         am start -a VIEW -d URI
#   exec SH...         run shell on the host (proxy, CA, dumps -- logged verbatim)
#   flows [N]          tail N lines of the decrypted-flows log
#   status             heartbeat on demand
#   quit               end the session (falls through to publish/upload)
#
# Results go to live-res/results/NNN/ (out.txt + shot.png + ui.xml).
# live-res/status.txt is a heartbeat; live_tail.txt carries this script's own
# output so a crash is visible from outside instead of only at job end.
#
# LOUD FAILURE IS THE POINT: a silent push failure here once cost a whole
# multi-hour session, because the loop spun happily with a broken results dir
# and nothing looked wrong until the job ended. So every push is retried, the
# very first one is a probe that aborts the step on failure, and a watchdog
# aborts if nothing has been published for PUSH_WATCHDOG_SECS.
